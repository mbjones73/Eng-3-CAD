## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

### Evidence
[The Base in Onshape](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/0d70f655203ca304cb3c5b7d/w/f55603f962f6fc74f5548a68/e/41d730c570a8d75fce9f51b6)

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)  I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

## Mount

### Description
In this assignment I created the mount part of the caster. It is a 120 mm square extruded 8 mm with a 25 mm hole in the center and four 10 mm holes whose centers are 20 mm away from the edge.

## Fork

### Description
In this assignment I designed the fork that attaches the axle to the base of the caster. It has a circular base with two prongs, with holes for the axle, and a cylinder on the top that attaches to the base

## Tire

### Description
In this assignment I designed the tire of the caster. It is a trapezoid revolved around the origin to make the wheel, with fillets on both sides to round the edges

### Reflection
fillets make the sides round
Revole was a bi ghelp to make a circle

## Wheel

### Description
In this assignment I designed the wheel of the caster. It is revolved I shape with holes cut to make spokes, then some fillets.

### Reflection
A wiseman (A.K.A Mr.Helmsetter) always told me" work smarter not harder" that played a big role today with the cuts. Instead of doing every cut 1 by 1 use revole around the center.

## AxleCollarBearings

### Description
In this assignment I made the axle, which is a cylinder with flat cuts on the ends for set screws, a collar that attaches to the end of the axle, and two different sized bearings.
